# Dementia-Diagnosis

## Overview

**Dementia-Diagnosis** is a cognitive assessment application designed to support the screening and evaluation of cognitive impairment through structured tasks, questionnaires, and data-driven analysis. The application is intended for research, educational, and decision-support purposes only and is not a standalone medical diagnostic tool.

The system aims to identify patterns associated with cognitive decline by aggregating performance metrics across multiple cognitive domains such as memory, attention, and executive function. It is designed to support longitudinal tracking and comparative analysis over time.
