# Dementia-Diagnosis

## Overview

**Dementia-Diagnosis** is a cognitive assessment application designed to support the screening and evaluation of cognitive impairment through structured tasks, questionnaires, and data-driven analysis. The application is intended for research, educational, and decision-support purposes only and is not a standalone medical diagnostic tool.

The system aims to identify patterns associated with cognitive decline by aggregating performance metrics across multiple cognitive domains such as memory, attention, and executive function. It is designed to support longitudinal tracking and comparative analysis over time.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dementia-Diagnosis.git
cd Dementia-Diagnosis

Install dependencies (example for Python-based projects):

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you are using a virtual environment, it is recommended to activate it before installing dependencies.

## Usage

Start the application

python main.py


Complete the cognitive assessment

Users are guided through a series of cognitive tasks and questionnaires.

Responses and performance metrics are recorded automatically during the session.

Review results

The application generates summary scores and domain-level insights.

Results may be displayed within the application or exported for further analysis.

## Data & Privacy

This project does not include production-grade data security by default.

Any deployment involving real user data should comply with applicable privacy and research regulations (e.g., HIPAA, IRB requirements).

Developers are responsible for implementing appropriate safeguards such as encryption, access control, and anonymization.

## Intended Use

This application is intended for:

Academic and clinical research

Educational demonstrations

Prototype clinical decision-support tools

Exploratory analysis of cognitive performance data

It is not intended for independent clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions.

## Limitations

Outputs are indicative and probabilistic rather than definitive diagnoses.

Performance may vary across populations, languages, and testing environments.

The application does not replace professional clinical judgment, neuropsychological evaluation, or medical imaging.

## Disclaimer

This software is not a medical device.

It is provided for research and educational purposes only and must not be used as a substitute for professional medical diagnosis, treatment, or medical advice. Any clinical use requires appropriate regulatory approval and medical supervision.

If you want, next I can:
- Add a **Methods / Cognitive Domains** section describing task types  
- Tighten language to be **NIH SBIR / FDA SaMD–safe**
- Write a **technical README** for researchers and developers
- Add an **Ethics & Bias Considerations** section (strongly recommended)

Just tell me.
